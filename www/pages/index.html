        <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>I am Anthony Pizzimenti. I am a student, developer, tutor, and hockey player.</p>

        <p>
            I attend the University of Iowa and am working toward Computer Science and Mathematics degrees, as well as a certificate in Large Data Analysis.
            I work as a full-stack software developer at the University of Iowa Information Technology services, and do quite a bit of open-source development
            on the side. I am also a tutor at the University, so see the <a href="http://apizzimenti.com/contact">contact</a> page for more info there.
            Finally, I sit on the <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/">College of Liberal Arts</a> and Sciences Student Technology Fees board, which decides
            how to parcel a ~$2m budget to each department.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy spending time with my family, my friends, and working on projects that help others. I consider myself involved in politics
            (local and state included) in an effort to build community and change things for the better. Aside from that, I'm a pretty good pool player and
            I can make a mean pasta dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always dabbled in media creation, and I'll be starting up a podcast called Idaho City, Ohio in the 2017 Fall semester which talks about the
            happenings at the University and Iowa City. My favorite podcasts are anything from <a href="https://headgum.com/">HeadGum</a>,
            <a href="https://crooked.com/">Crooked Media</a>, and the fine people at <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>. A few favorite TV shows include
            The Office, Riverdale, Parks and Recreation, and The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
        </p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite languages are JavaScript [<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">1</a>]
            [<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">2</a>] and its flavors of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>
            and <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, Python[<a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/">1</a>]
            [<a href="https://github.com/apizzimenti/python-manual">2</a>], <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/begin.html">C</a>,
            and <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/Bash-Beginners-Guide.html">Bash</a>. Aside from my favorite languages, I have done work in
            C#, C++, PHP, (too much) Java, and a hint of R. A very disparate set of languages, yes, but they are the ones I've chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have done quite a bit of open-source work in JavaScript and Python, which you can see on the projects page
            and on <a href="https://github.com/apizzimenti/">github</a>. I plan on doing more open-source work related to networking and internet privacy this upcoming
            year. If you want to collab with me on an open-source project, please feel free to <a href="http://apizzimenti.com/contact">get in touch with me</a> and
            we'll get to work right away.
